The .ipynb included in this folder contains all the data preparation and cleaning steps for the GenAge dataset, including removing duplicates, corrupted entries. Only the genes associated with gene products that have experimental and HT-supported BP annotations and map into the STRING database were retained (see genage_full.txt file for cleaned-up data). In addition, all experimental, HT-based BP annotations for C. elegans proteins were prepared, and only annotated proteins that map into the STRING PPI were retained. Annotations were propagated, and a dictionary file with proteins (by STRING IDs) and all annotations as values was generated (prop_ANNO_STRING.txt file).
