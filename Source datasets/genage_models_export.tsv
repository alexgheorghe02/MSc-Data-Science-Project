After prolonged developmental times at 15 - 20 C, they mature into extremely long-lived adults with near-normal feeding rates and motility. They survive to a median of 145-190 days at 20 C, with nearly 10-fold extension of both median and maximum adult lifespan relative to N2DRM, a long-lived wild-type stock into which the null mutant was outcrossed. PI3K-null adults, although a little less thermotolerant, are considerably more resistant to oxidative and electrophilic stresses than worms bearing normal or less long-lived alleles. Their unprecedented factorial gains in survival, under both normal and toxic environments, are attributed to elimination of residual and maternally-contributed PI3KCS or its products, and consequent modification of kinase signaling cascades. 	anti	1000	1000	Mutation

Lifespan extension is independent of the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16, which mediates the effects of the insulin-like signalling pathway on ageing. Furthermore, IFE-2 deficiency further extends the lifespan of long-lived age (30%) and daf (15% maximum lifespan) nematode mutants. Knockdown of ife-2 extends the lifespan (50% maximum lifespan) of glp-4(bn2) mutant animals lacking a germ line. Similarly, lack of IFE-2 enhances the long-lived phenotype of clk (30% maximum lifespan) and dietary-restricted eat mutant animals (30% maximum lifespan). Knockdown of target of rapamycin (TOR), a phosphatidylinositol kinase that controls protein synthesis in response to nutrient cues, further increases the longevity of ife-2 mutants (10-15% maximum lifespan).

Interestingly, four RNAi clones (ZC123.3; nhr-119; ceh-37; and aha-1) affected wild-type and isp-1;ctb-1 mutant worms' lifespan to the same extent but exerted only a moderate or no effect on daf-16 and age-1 mutant longevity.	pro		45	RNA interference
