This folder contains part of the datasets manipulated as part of this study:

1. The go-basic.OBO file containing the Gene Ontology
2. The raw GenAge dataset of ageing genes
3. The STRING C. elegans protein aliases mapping file (UniProt to STRING).

In addition the C. elegans STRING PPI network was downloaded from: https://string-db.org/cgi/download, using the C. elegans taxon. The network file is too big to include.
